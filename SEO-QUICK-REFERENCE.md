### What are Local Keywords?

Keywords that include location, like:

- "therapist Cincinnati" instead of just "therapist"
- "trauma therapy Cincinnati OH"
- "counselor near me"

### Why Google Business Profile Matters

When someone searches "counselor Cincinnati," Google shows:

1. **Ads** (paid)
2. **Map Pack** (top 3 local businesses) ‚≠ê THIS IS YOUR GOAL
3. Organic results

The Map Pack gets 40%+ of clicks. To get in it, you MUST have a Google Business Profile.

## üìû Business Information (NAP)

**Always use EXACTLY this format everywhere:**

Redbird Counseling and Consulting

Cincinnati, OH 45227
(513) 279-8949
https://www.meetredbirdcounseling.com
